# EKS Upgrade Readiness Skill

## Overview

This skill assesses your live EKS cluster's readiness for a Kubernetes version upgrade. It connects to your cluster via AWS CLI and kubectl, runs automated checks across 8 assessment areas, calculates a readiness score (0-100%), and produces a detailed report with prioritized remediation steps and pre-filled AWS CLI commands.

This skill is laser-focused on **upgrade safety** — answering the question: "Is it safe to upgrade this cluster to the next version?"

## What Gets Assessed

| # | Section | Key Checks |
|---|---------|------------|
| 01 | Version Validation | Upgrade path validity, version skew policy, support status |
| 02 | Breaking Changes | Version-specific API removals, behavioral changes, resource impact |
| 03 | Deprecated API Detection | Live scan of cluster resources for deprecated/removed APIs |
| 04 | Add-on Compatibility | Core add-on versions, OSS add-on matrix, Karpenter compatibility |
| 05 | Node Readiness | Node version skew, AL2→AL2023 migration, AMI compatibility |
| 06 | Workload Risks | Single replicas, missing PDBs, health probes, resource requests |
| 07 | AWS Upgrade Insights | Official EKS pre-upgrade checks and recommendations |
| 08 | Upgrade Plan | Pre-filled CLI commands, step-by-step upgrade sequence |

## Readiness Score

The skill calculates a weighted readiness score:

| Category | Max Deduction | Rationale |
|----------|--------------|-----------|
| Breaking Changes | 25 pts | Highest risk — can break apps |
| Deprecated APIs | 20 pts | Actionable, fixable pre-upgrade |
| Node Version Skew | 20 pts | Can block upgrade entirely |
| Add-on Compatibility | 15 pts | Critical > optional add-ons |
| Karpenter | 10 pts | Only if installed |
| Workload Risks | 10 pts | Best-practice, not blockers |
| AWS Upgrade Insights | 10 pts | Official AWS checks |
| AL2 Nodes / Behavioral | 10 pts | Informational |

**Score Interpretation:**
- 90-100: **READY** — Safe to proceed
- 80-89: **GOOD** — Minor issues, can proceed with caution
- 70-79: **FAIR** — Several issues need attention first
- 60-69: **RISKY** — Significant issues, not recommended yet
- 0-59: **NOT READY** — Critical blockers, must resolve first

## Prerequisites

1. **AWS credentials configured** — `aws configure` or `~/.aws/credentials` with EKS access
2. **kubectl access** to the target cluster (for Kubernetes API queries)
3. **Required AWS Permissions:**
   - `eks:DescribeCluster`, `eks:ListClusters`, `eks:ListNodegroups`, `eks:DescribeNodegroup`
   - `eks:ListAddons`, `eks:DescribeAddon`, `eks:ListInsights`, `eks:DescribeInsight`
   - `ec2:DescribeSubnets`
   - `iam:GetRole`, `iam:ListAttachedRolePolicies`, `iam:ListRolePolicies`, `iam:GetRolePolicy`

### MCP Server Setup

This skill uses two MCP servers, both pre-configured in `.mcp.json` at the project root:

- `awslabs.eks-mcp-server` — connects to your EKS cluster
- `awslabs.aws-documentation-mcp-server` — looks up AWS documentation during assessment

On first launch, Claude Code will prompt you to enable both servers. If MCP servers are not available, the skill falls back to AWS CLI and kubectl commands.

### Configuration

The skill uses your existing AWS credentials. No additional configuration needed if `aws eks list-clusters` works from your terminal.

To use a specific profile or region, set environment variables:
```bash
export AWS_PROFILE=your-profile-name
export AWS_REGION=your-region
```

### Getting Started

Invoke the skill: `/eks-upgrade`

Or simply ask: *"Run an EKS upgrade readiness assessment"*

The skill will discover your clusters, ask which one to assess and what target version, then run the full assessment.

## Assessment Workflow

### Step 0: Pre-flight

**Action 1 — List clusters (test connectivity & discover clusters)**

Run `aws eks list-clusters` to discover available clusters.

- ✅ Success → Show the cluster list. Ask which cluster to assess. If only one cluster, confirm it.
- ❌ Failure → STOP. Do NOT retry more than once. Show:

> **Cannot access EKS clusters.** Try these steps:
> 1. Check that AWS credentials are configured: `aws sts get-caller-identity`
> 2. Check your region: `aws eks list-clusters --region <region>`
> 3. Run the permission check: `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tools/check_permissions.sh`

Wait for the user to resolve the issue.

**Action 2 — Describe the selected cluster**

Run `aws eks describe-cluster --name <cluster>` and show: cluster name, Kubernetes version, platform version, region, status, account ID.

**Action 3 — Validate permissions**

After describing the cluster, verify key permissions by attempting:
1. `aws eks list-nodegroups --cluster-name <cluster>`
2. `aws eks list-addons --cluster-name <cluster>`
3. `aws eks list-insights --cluster-name <cluster>`

If any fail with AccessDenied, show the user which permission is missing and point them to `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tools/check_permissions.sh <cluster> <region>` for a full check. Do NOT proceed until permissions are confirmed.

**Action 4 — Determine target version**

Ask: *"Your cluster is on v[current]. The next version is v[current+1]. Shall I assess upgrade readiness to v[current+1]?"*

If the user specifies a version more than 1 minor version ahead, explain that EKS requires one-version-at-a-time upgrades and show the required path (e.g., 1.29 → 1.30 → 1.31 → 1.32). Offer to assess the first hop.

**Action 5 — Confirm and proceed**

### Steps 1-8: Run Assessment

Read each steering file in order from `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/steering/`. For each section:
1. Read the steering file
2. Execute the checks described in it using AWS CLI and kubectl commands
3. Collect findings with severity ratings

**Steering file loading guide:**

| User Request | Steering File(s) |
|---|---|
| Full upgrade assessment | ALL files in order |
| Version / upgrade path | `steering/version-validation.md` |
| Breaking changes / API removals | `steering/breaking-changes.md` |
| Deprecated APIs | `steering/deprecated-apis.md` |
| Add-on compatibility / Karpenter | `steering/addon-compatibility.md` |
| Node readiness / AL2 / AMI | `steering/node-readiness.md` |
| Workload risks / PDB / probes | `steering/workload-risks.md` |
| AWS Insights | `steering/upgrade-insights.md` |
| Generate report | `steering/report-generation.md` |

### Step 9: Calculate Score & Generate Report

Read `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/steering/report-generation.md` and produce the report.

## Tool Usage Rules

1. **Do NOT call any tools when this skill is first activated.** Wait for the user to ask.
2. **Do NOT hardcode or guess cluster names.** Always discover by listing first.
3. **Do NOT retry a failed command more than once.**
4. **Always read the relevant steering file before executing checks for that section.**
5. **Use `aws` CLI and `kubectl` for cluster queries.** If MCP servers are available, prefer them for EKS operations.

## Data Files

- **OSS Add-on Compatibility Matrix:** `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/data/oss_addon_matrix.json` — use as fallback when web search is unavailable
- **Permission Check Script:** `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tools/check_permissions.sh` — pre-flight validator
- **HTML Converter:** `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tools/md_to_html.py` — converts markdown reports to HTML

## Report Output

- **Markdown:** `EKS-Upgrade-Assessment-<cluster>-<version>-<YYYY-MM-DD>-<HHMM>.md`
- **HTML:** Run `python3 ${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/tools/md_to_html.py <report>.md` to convert

Do NOT generate HTML manually. Always use the conversion script.
